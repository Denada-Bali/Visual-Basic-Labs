A store sells Computers (HP, Dell, Apple), Printers (Canon, Xerox, Epson) and Accessories (Mouse, Cable, Adapter). Write a program to compute a customer's bill. The form would have a
check box for each of the items (Computers & Printers & Accessories), a group box for each of the options of the item and a corresponding box for the quantity for each of the options; a button for calculating and displaying the bill details; and a box to output the bill details. The
group box and quantity box are invisible. The group box becomes visible only when its corresponding check box is checked. The quantity box becomes visible only when its corresponding option is selected. The client cannot buy multiple items from a category. Calculate the total cost with a Function procedure. Use a Sub procedure to display the itemized bill with name of the items, quantity, price, and the total. (Define the price of the items by yourself.)
